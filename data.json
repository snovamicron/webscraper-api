            "review_description": "I highly recommend this product, its excellent very soft and fine fur quality, no thinness of fur, fur is uniform all over the teddy bear and cotton stuffing is perfect, rather quite adequate and of very good premium quality...Height of teddy purchased is 5 feet, pink color (more towards light pink) and measured almost the same as 5 feet in height as my daughter's height, as can be seen in the pic .... In one of the pic, the 2 dark pink teddies on either side are from another toy brand purchased from Amazon, it is 4 feet in length, costing Rs. 749/- each and the quality difference is a lot as compared to this 5 feet teddy which is of much better quality and heavier too... 4 feet would have been perfect length instead of 5 feet due to the weight of the teddy, which will be approximately around 3 kgs, maybe bit heavy for small children to carry but perfect for bigger kids and adults as gifts....  My mother purchased this as a birthday gift for my daughter from Amazon, my daughter liked it very much...!! We got the teddy along with 2 other small soft toys as combo offer,  a white rabbit and a unicorn (which turned out to be very good quality too) as the combo offer  seemed quite good.!I highly recommend the soft toy products from this particular brand, it is value for money, you will not feel cheated at all in terms of the very good premium quality of the fur and stuffing of the teddy bear! One can safely buy from this brand as it is very good value for money, the same teddy bear in Hallmark showroom would cost nearly 4000-5000 Rs.Overall an excellent product and I am highly satisfied with the superb silky soft quality of the fur material...! Thanks Amazon, a big thumbs up to the brand for excellent quality, a very delighted customer  :-) !",
